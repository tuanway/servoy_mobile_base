Simple Mobile Framework Guide

The mobile framework is a simple project that is intended to help Servoy developers create responsive applications without solely relying on advanced type forms.  By using containers and simple naming conventions we can seperate mobile/desktop designs and still share business or other abstract logic.   Before starting with this framework, it is expected that the developer has some basic training already on Servoy and understands the concept of inheritance and foundsets.
